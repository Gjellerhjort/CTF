# Dig Dug

we get the domain server: tryhackme Ip Address
so we have to look up records for the domain **givemetheflag.com** in the domain server
the name of the CTF is Dig Dug and i know a tool called Dig so i think we have to use that

`dig @10.10.106.152 givemetheflag.com TXT`

and i got the flag easy!
